      summary:"Marie Curie was a pioneering researcher in the field of radioactivity who was Polish and naturalized-French. She was the first woman to get a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to do it twice, and the only one to receive the award in two different scientific categories. The first married pair to receive the Nobel Prize, she and her husband Pierre Curie established the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes as co-winners of her first prize. At the University of Paris, she was the first woman to hold the position of professor in 1906.",
      cardA:"Marie and Pierre Curie began looking into radioactivity after Henri Becquerel made his discovery of it in 1896. They looked for radioactivity in a variety of materials and minerals. Since pitchblende was more radioactive than uranium, they deduced that it must also include other radioactive materials. They were able to separate two previously undiscovered elements from it, polonium and radium, both of which are more radioactive than uranium.",
      cardB:"She was renowned for her integrity and restrained way of living. She had been given a minor scholarship in 1893, which she returned in 1897 as soon as she started getting paid. She donated a large portion of the proceeds from her first Nobel Prize to her friends, family, students, and scientific collaborators. Curie made an unusual choice by choosing not to patent the radium-isolation method so that the scientific community may conduct research without restriction. She requested that any financial gifts or honors be given to the scientific organizations she was associated with, not to her personally. She and her spouse frequently declined honors and decorations. She was supposedly the only person who could not be corrupted by fame, according to Albert Einstein's remark.",

Through this, she discovered the relationship between the fine constrictions in the pores of coals and the permeability of the porous space. By concluding that substances were expelled in order of molecular size as temperature increased, she helped classify coals and accurately predict their performance for fuel purposes and for production of wartime devices such as gas masks. This work was the basis of her PhD thesis The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal for which the University of Cambridge awarded her a PhD in 1945.",

Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces, and she also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods.",

      summary:" Ada Lovelace was an English Mathematician who is regarded as the world’s first computer programmer! In 1836, she wrote the world’s first computer program known as an algorithm for an Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. In 1852, Lovelace died due to an illness at only 37 years old. However, despite her short life, she made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics and computer science that can still be seen to this day. She is still regarded as the first person to understand the potential of a computing machine. Without the contributions of Ada Lovelace, the modern computer and associated algorithms that we take for granted may not exist ‘The more I study, the more insatiable do I feel my genius for it to be.-	Ana Lovelace.",
      cardA:" In June 1833 Lovelace’s tutor, Mary Somerville, introduced her to British mathematician, philosopher, and inventor Charles Babbage, now widely considered to have been the “father of the computer.” Lovelace became fascinated with Babbage’s groundbreaking work on his mechanical calculating device, he called the Analytical Engine.In 1842, Babbage asked Lovelace to translate from French into English a scholarly article on his calculating machine written by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea. Ada not only translated the article, but she also supplemented it with an elaborate analytical section she simply titled “Notes,” comprised of Note A to Note G. Lovelace’s seven notes, now revered as a milestone in the history of computers, contained what many consider to have been the first computer program—a structured set of instructions to be carried out by a machine. In her Note G, Lovelace describes an algorithm that would instruct Babbage’s Analytical Engine to accurately compute Bernoulli numbers. Today it is considered to have been the first algorithm specifically created to be implemented on a computer, and the reason Lovelace is often called the first computer programmer. Since Babbage never completed his Analytical Engine, Lovelace’s program was never tested. However, her process for having a machine repeat a series of instructions, called “looping,” remains a staple of computer programming today.",
      cardB:" The computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace. The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth. Since 1998 the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal,[92] and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students. BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates. Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London focused on digital skills",

      cardB:" Jemison faced many roadblocks to her dreams of pursuing science. Once, when Jemison said she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up, her teacher asked if she meant a nurse. She later founded The Earth We Share (TEWS), an international science camp that encourages science literacy for all. She was on an episode of Star Trek! Jemison began each of her shifts in space by saying, “Hailing frequencies open,” a reference to Lieutenant Uhura on Star Trek. In 1993, Jemison appeared in her own episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation as Lieutenant Palmer. She has also written several books and appeared on many television programs including an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Currently, Jemison is leading the 100 Year Starship project through the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
