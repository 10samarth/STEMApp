      summary:"Marie Curie was a pioneering researcher in the field of radioactivity who was Polish and naturalized-French. She was the first woman to get a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to do it twice, and the only one to receive the award in two different scientific categories. The first married pair to receive the Nobel Prize, she and her husband Pierre Curie established the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes as co-winners of her first prize. At the University of Paris, she was the first woman to hold the position of professor in 1906.",
      cardA:"Marie and Pierre Curie began looking into radioactivity after Henri Becquerel made his discovery of it in 1896. They looked for radioactivity in a variety of materials and minerals. Since pitchblende was more radioactive than uranium, they deduced that it must also include other radioactive materials. They were able to separate two previously undiscovered elements from it, polonium and radium, both of which are more radioactive than uranium.",
      cardB:"She was renowned for her integrity and restrained way of living. She had been given a minor scholarship in 1893, which she returned in 1897 as soon as she started getting paid. She donated a large portion of the proceeds from her first Nobel Prize to her friends, family, students, and scientific collaborators. Curie made an unusual choice by choosing not to patent the radium-isolation method so that the scientific community may conduct research without restriction. She requested that any financial gifts or honors be given to the scientific organizations she was associated with, not to her personally. She and her spouse frequently declined honors and decorations. She was supposedly the only person who could not be corrupted by fame, according to Albert Einstein's remark.",

        awards: ["Franklin was never nominated for a Nobel Prize, but her work was a crucial part in the discovery of DNA's structure, which along with subsequent related work led to Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1962. She had died in 1958, and during her lifetime the DNA structure was not considered to be fully proven. It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure."],
        summary:"Rosalind Franklin was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.[2] Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during her life.",
        cardA:"She studied the porosity of coal using helium to determine its density. Through this, she discovered the relationship between the fine constrictions in the pores of coals and the permeability of the porous space. By concluding that substances were expelled in order of molecular size as temperature increased, she helped classify coals and accurately predict their performance for fuel purposes and for production of wartime devices such as gas masks. This work was the basis of her PhD thesis The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal for which the University of Cambridge awarded her a PhD in 1945.",
        cardB:"Franklin is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA while at King's College London, particularly Photo 51, taken by her student Raymond Gosling, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix for which Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962.",

        summary:"Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.",
        cardA:"Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited.",
        cardB:"Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games. The impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.",

Jointly with her husband, Joliot-Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for their claimed discovery of Induced radioactivity, making them the second-ever married couple (after her parents) to win the Nobel Prize, while adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date.",

From 1928 Joliot-Curie and her husband Frédéric combined their research efforts on the study of atomic nuclei.",
        cardB:"In 1948, using work on nuclear fission, the Joliot-Curies along with other scientists created the first French nuclear reactor. Irène's group pioneered research into radium nuclei that led a separate group of German physicists, led by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassman, to discover nuclear fission: the splitting of the nucleus itself, emitting vast amounts of energy. Lise Meitner's now-famous calculations actually disproved Irène's results to show that nuclear fission was possible.",
