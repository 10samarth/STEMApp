      birthDate: "7 November 1867",

      summary:"Marie Curie was a pioneering researcher in the field of radioactivity who was Polish and naturalized-French. She was the first woman to get a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to do it twice, and the only one to receive the award in two different scientific categories. The first married pair to receive the Nobel Prize, she and her husband Pierre Curie established the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes as co-winners of her first prize. At the University of Paris, she was the first woman to hold the position of professor in 1906.",
      cardA:"Marie and Pierre Curie began looking into radioactivity after Henri Becquerel made his discovery of it in 1896. They looked for radioactivity in a variety of materials and minerals. Since pitchblende was more radioactive than uranium, they deduced that it must also include other radioactive materials. They were able to separate two previously undiscovered elements from it, polonium and radium, both of which are more radioactive than uranium.",
      cardB:"She was renowned for her integrity and restrained way of living. She had been given a minor scholarship in 1893, which she returned in 1897 as soon as she started getting paid. She donated a large portion of the proceeds from her first Nobel Prize to her friends, family, students, and scientific collaborators. Curie made an unusual choice by choosing not to patent the radium-isolation method so that the scientific community may conduct research without restriction. She requested that any financial gifts or honors be given to the scientific organizations she was associated with, not to her personally. She and her spouse frequently declined honors and decorations. She was supposedly the only person who could not be corrupted by fame, according to Albert Einstein's remark.",

        summary:"Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.",
        cardA:"Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited.",
        cardB:"Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games. The impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.",

        summary:"Chien-Shiung Wu was a Chinese-American particle and experimental physicist who made significant contributions in the fields of nuclear and particle physics. Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium into uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which proved that parity is not conserved. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics, while Wu herself was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978.",
        cardA:"Although Wu ended up doing scientific research, her writing was considered outstanding thanks to her early training. Her Chinese calligraphy was praised by others. Before matriculating to National Central University Wu spent the summer preparing for her studies with her usual full force.",
        cardB:"From 1930 to 1934, Wu studied at National Central University (now known as Nanjing University) and first majored in mathematics but later transferred to physics. Wu was elected as one of the student leaders by her colleagues. For two years after graduation, she did graduate-level study in physics and worked as an assistant at Zhejiang University. She became a researcher at the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica.",
