      birthDate: "20 September 1910",

      awards: ["Nobel Prize in Physics (1903),", "Davy Medal (1903)"],
      summary:"Marie Curie was a pioneering researcher in the field of radioactivity who was Polish and naturalized-French. She was the first woman to get a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to do it twice, and the only one to receive the award in two different scientific categories. The first married pair to receive the Nobel Prize, she and her husband Pierre Curie established the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes as co-winners of her first prize. At the University of Paris, she was the first woman to hold the position of professor in 1906.",
      cardA:"Marie and Pierre Curie began looking into radioactivity after Henri Becquerel made his discovery of it in 1896. They looked for radioactivity in a variety of materials and minerals. Since pitchblende was more radioactive than uranium, they deduced that it must also include other radioactive materials. They were able to separate two previously undiscovered elements from it, polonium and radium, both of which are more radioactive than uranium.",
      cardB:"She was renowned for her integrity and restrained way of living. She had been given a minor scholarship in 1893, which she returned in 1897 as soon as she started getting paid. She donated a large portion of the proceeds from her first Nobel Prize to her friends, family, students, and scientific collaborators. Curie made an unusual choice by choosing not to patent the radium-isolation method so that the scientific community may conduct research without restriction. She requested that any financial gifts or honors be given to the scientific organizations she was associated with, not to her personally. She and her spouse frequently declined honors and decorations. She was supposedly the only person who could not be corrupted by fame, according to Albert Einstein's remark.",
