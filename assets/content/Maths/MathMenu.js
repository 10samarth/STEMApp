    summary:
      "Marie Curie was a pioneering researcher in the field of radioactivity who was Polish and naturalized-French. She was the first woman to get a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to do it twice, and the only one to receive the award in two different scientific categories. The first married pair to receive the Nobel Prize, she and her husband Pierre Curie established the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes as co-winners of her first prize. At the University of Paris, she was the first woman to hold the position of professor in 1906.",
    cardA:
      "Marie and Pierre Curie began looking into radioactivity after Henri Becquerel made his discovery of it in 1896. They looked for radioactivity in a variety of materials and minerals. Since pitchblende was more radioactive than uranium, they deduced that it must also include other radioactive materials. They were able to separate two previously undiscovered elements from it, polonium and radium, both of which are more radioactive than uranium.",
    cardB:
      "She was renowned for her integrity and restrained way of living. She had been given a minor scholarship in 1893, which she returned in 1897 as soon as she started getting paid. She donated a large portion of the proceeds from her first Nobel Prize to her friends, family, students, and scientific collaborators. Curie made an unusual choice by choosing not to patent the radium-isolation method so that the scientific community may conduct research without restriction. She requested that any financial gifts or honors be given to the scientific organizations she was associated with, not to her personally. She and her spouse frequently declined honors and decorations. She was supposedly the only person who could not be corrupted by fame, according to Albert Einstein's remark.",

    summary:
      "She was a German mathematician who made many important contributions to abstract algebra. She discovered Noether's First and Second Theorem, which are fundamental in mathematical physics.[1] She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed some theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.",
    cardA:
      "She sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own. Noether's work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring. The following year she published a paper called Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen, analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work revolutionary;the publication gave rise to the term Noetherian ring and the naming of several other mathematical objects as Noetherian. In 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, B.L. van der Waerden, arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was absolute beyond comparison.In 1931 he published Moderne Algebra, a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition based in part on lectures by E. Artin and E. Noether. Van der Waerden's visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian topologist Pavel Alexandrov lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as der Noether, using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was able only to help him secure a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation.[39][40] They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether the greatest woman mathematician of all time",
    cardB:
      "In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin received the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award for their contributions to mathematics.[61] The prize included a monetary reward of 500 ℛℳ and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor",

      "He was anEnglish mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author(described in his time as a 'natural philosopher'), widely recognised as one ofthe greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the mostinfluential scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical revolutionknown as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis PrincipiaMathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributionsto optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried WilhelmLeibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.",
    cardA:
      "He waseducated at Cambridge University (1661–65), where he discovered the work ofRené Descartes. His experiments passing sunlight through a prism led to thediscovery of the heterogeneous, corpuscular nature of white light and laid thefoundation of physical optics. He built the first reflecting telescope in 1668and became a professor of mathematics at Cambridge in 1669. He worked out thefundamentals of calculus, though this work went unpublished for more than 30years. His most famous publication, Principia Mathematica (1687), grew out ofcorrespondence with Edmond Halley. Describing his works on the laws of motion(see Newton’s laws of motion), orbital dynamics, tidal theory, and the theoryof universal gravitation, it is regarded as the seminal work of modern science.He was elected president of the Royal Society of London in 1703 and became thefirst scientist ever to be knighted in 1705. During his career he engaged inheated arguments with several of his colleagues, including Robert Hooke (overauthorship of the inverse square relation of gravitation) and G.W. Leibniz(over the authorship of calculus). The battle with Leibniz dominated the last25 years of his life; it is now well established that Newton developed calculusfirst, but that Leibniz was the first to publish on the subject. Newton isregarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time.",

She was a pioneer for women inmathematics around the world – the first woman to obtain a doctorate (in themodern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorshipin northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journalas an editor.[1] According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz,Kovalevskaya was 'the greatest known woman scientist before the twentiethcentury'",
    cardA:
      "The followingyear she moved to Berlin, where, having been refused admission to theuniversity on account of her gender, she studied privately with themathematician Karl Weierstrass. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partialdifferential equations, on Saturn’s rings, and on elliptic integrals—to theUniversity of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation and was awarded thedegree, summa cum laude, in absentia. Her paper on partial differentialequations, the most important of the three papers, won her valuable recognitionwithin the European mathematical community. It contains what is now commonlyknown as the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem, which gives conditions for theexistence of solutions to a certain class of partial differential equations.Having gained her degree, she returned to Russia, where her daughter was bornin 1878. She separated permanently from her husband in 1881. In 1883Kovalevskaya accepted Magnus Mittag-Leffler’s invitation to become a lecturerin mathematics at the University of Stockholm. She was promoted to fullprofessor in 1889. In 1884 she joined the editorial board of the mathematicaljournal Acta Mathematica, and in 1888 she became the first woman to be electeda corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
